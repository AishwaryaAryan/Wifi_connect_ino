# ESP8266 WiFi Connection üåê

## Overview  
This project demonstrates how to connect an ESP8266 to a *WiFi network* and print its *IP address* via the Serial Monitor.

## Features  
‚úÖ Connects ESP8266 to a WiFi network  
‚úÖ Prints *IP address* on successful connection  
‚úÖ Serial monitoring for connection status  

## Hardware Requirements  
- *ESP8266* (NodeMCU, Wemos D1 Mini, etc.)  
- *Arduino IDE* with ESP8266 board installed  

## Installation & Usage  
1. Open wifi_connect.ino in Arduino IDE.  
2. Replace ssid and password with your WiFi credentials.  
3. Upload the code to the ESP8266.  
4. Open the Serial Monitor at *115200 baud*.  
5. The ESP8266 will print its *IP Address* when connected.  

## Code Explanation  
- The ESP8266 attempts to *connect* to a WiFi network.  
- If successful, it prints the *local IP address* assigned by the router.  
- If disconnected, it retries until it connects.
